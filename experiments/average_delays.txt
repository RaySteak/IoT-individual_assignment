All averages computed over 100 sends, computed as half or round-trip time assuming
a symmetrically fast communication channel

sine(1, 1): 0.073037s
sine(1, 10) + sine(0.1, 100): 0.025659s
sine(1, 10): 0.037391s
sine(1, 100): 0.028240s
sine(5, 500): 0.033133s

Explanation for overall decrease: every 10 values or so there is a big delay,
but all the other values are up to par with the other sines. This suggests that the
mosquitto server has some weird optimization tactic depending on the rate at which
it receives messages. For 500Hz signal (sending at 1000Hz), the MQTT server
seems to behave more or less the same way as for 100Hz signal (sending at 200Hz).
From 100Hz to 500Hz, there actually seems to be a small increase even,
suggesting that the high frequency is starting to push the server a bit.
